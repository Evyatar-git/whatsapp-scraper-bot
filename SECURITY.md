# Security Documentation

## Overview

This project implements comprehensive security practices to ensure the application is protected against common vulnerabilities and follows security best practices.

## Security Features Implemented

### 1. Container Security

#### Multi-stage Docker Build
- **Purpose**: Reduces attack surface by excluding build tools from production image
- **Implementation**: Uses separate builder stage for dependencies, clean production stage for runtime
- **Benefits**: Smaller image size, fewer vulnerabilities, better performance

#### Non-root User
- **Purpose**: Prevents privilege escalation attacks
- **Implementation**: Creates dedicated `appuser` with minimal permissions
- **Benefits**: Limits damage if container is compromised

#### Health Checks
- **Purpose**: Ensures application is running correctly and can detect failures
- **Implementation**: Built-in HTTP health check endpoint
- **Benefits**: Better orchestration, faster failure detection

### 2. Vulnerability Scanning

#### Container Image Scanning (Trivy)
- **What it scans**: OS packages, language dependencies, configuration issues
- **When it runs**: On every push, PR, and weekly schedule
- **Action taken**: Fails build on critical vulnerabilities

#### Python Dependency Scanning
- **Tools used**: Safety (PyPI database), pip-audit (PyPA scanner)
- **What it finds**: Known vulnerabilities in installed Python packages
- **Frequency**: Every code change and weekly updates

#### Code Security Analysis (Bandit)
- **Purpose**: Identifies security anti-patterns in Python code
- **Checks for**: Hardcoded secrets, SQL injection, weak crypto, etc.
- **Integration**: Pre-commit hooks and CI/CD pipeline

### 3. Pre-commit Security Hooks

#### Secret Detection
- **Tool**: detect-secrets
- **Purpose**: Prevents accidental commit of API keys, passwords, tokens
- **How it works**: Scans staged files for high-entropy strings and known patterns

#### Code Quality and Security
- **Tools**: ruff (formatting/linting), bandit (security), safety (dependencies)
- **Benefits**: Catches issues before they reach the repository
- **Developer experience**: Fast feedback loop, consistent code quality

### 4. Monitoring and Observability

#### Prometheus Metrics
- **Business metrics**: Weather requests by city, message types, error rates
- **Technical metrics**: Response times, database operations, HTTP requests
- **Purpose**: Detect anomalies and performance issues

#### Grafana Dashboards
- **Visualization**: Real-time dashboards for application health
- **Alerting**: Can be configured to alert on suspicious patterns
- **Business intelligence**: Understanding usage patterns and performance

## Security Scanning Commands

### Local Development
```bash
# Run comprehensive security scan
make security-scan

# Quick dependency scan only
make security-scan-quick

# Scan Docker container only
make security-scan-container

# Install and run pre-commit hooks
make pre-commit-install
make pre-commit-run
```

### Understanding Scan Results

#### Trivy Container Scan
- **CRITICAL**: Immediate action required - blocks deployment
- **HIGH**: Should be fixed soon - may block deployment
- **MEDIUM**: Should be addressed in next release
- **LOW**: Good to fix but not urgent

#### Safety Dependency Scan
- Reports known vulnerabilities in Python packages
- Provides CVE numbers and severity ratings
- Suggests version updates to fix issues

#### Bandit Code Scan
- **HIGH confidence + HIGH severity**: Likely real security issue
- **MEDIUM confidence**: May be false positive, review carefully
- **LOW confidence**: Often false positive but worth reviewing

## Security Best Practices Implemented

### 1. Secrets Management
- No hardcoded secrets in code
- Environment variable configuration
- Kubernetes secrets for sensitive data
- AWS SSM Parameter Store for production

### 2. Network Security
- Container runs on non-privileged port (8000)
- Health check endpoint doesn't expose sensitive information
- Twilio webhook signature validation

### 3. Input Validation
- Pydantic models validate all input data
- City name validation prevents injection attacks
- Request size limits and timeouts

### 4. Error Handling
- No sensitive information in error messages
- Structured logging without secrets
- Graceful failure handling

## CI/CD Security Pipeline

### GitHub Actions Workflow
1. **Code checkout** - Secure source code retrieval
2. **Dependency installation** - Only from trusted sources
3. **Security scanning** - Multiple tools for comprehensive coverage
4. **Vulnerability assessment** - Automated pass/fail decisions
5. **Report generation** - Human-readable summaries
6. **Artifact storage** - Detailed reports for investigation

### Security Gates
- **Pre-commit**: Prevents insecure code from being committed
- **PR checks**: Scans all changes before merge
- **Deployment gates**: Blocks deployment of vulnerable containers
- **Scheduled scans**: Weekly checks for new vulnerabilities

## Monitoring Security Events

### Metrics to Watch
- Unusual request patterns (potential attacks)
- High error rates (possible exploitation attempts)
- Database operation anomalies
- Response time spikes (DoS indicators)

### Log Analysis
- Failed authentication attempts
- Invalid input patterns
- Unusual geographic access patterns
- Error message patterns

## Incident Response

### If Vulnerabilities are Found
1. **Assess severity** - Critical issues get immediate attention
2. **Update dependencies** - Use `pip-audit --fix` where possible
3. **Test thoroughly** - Ensure fixes don't break functionality
4. **Deploy quickly** - Security fixes should be fast-tracked
5. **Document** - Record what was fixed and why

### Security Incident Checklist
1. Isolate affected systems
2. Assess scope of compromise
3. Collect evidence (logs, metrics)
4. Apply fixes
5. Monitor for continued issues
6. Update security measures
7. Post-incident review

## Compliance and Auditing

### Security Reports
- All scans generate JSON reports for auditing
- GitHub Security tab tracks vulnerabilities over time
- Prometheus metrics provide historical security data

### Compliance Features
- Container security scanning (SOC2, ISO27001)
- Dependency vulnerability tracking (NIST guidelines)
- Code security analysis (OWASP top 10)
- Audit trail through Git history and CI/CD logs

## Updating Security Tools

### Keeping Scanners Current
```bash
# Update pre-commit hooks
pre-commit autoupdate

# Update security tools
pip install --upgrade safety bandit pip-audit

# Update container scanners (automatic in CI/CD)
# Trivy database updates automatically
```

### Regular Security Tasks
- Weekly: Review security scan results
- Monthly: Update base Docker images
- Quarterly: Review and update security policies
- Annually: Full security architecture review
